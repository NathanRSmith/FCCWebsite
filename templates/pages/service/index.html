                The following sub-pages are intended to give you a glimpse into our committment to doing mininstry for our local community. Our life in Jesus is not simply about church services and Bible studies, it also means we help one another in practical daily ways. While no church can do everything, we have tried to focus on a few areas in which we can do well.
