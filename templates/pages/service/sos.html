            Summer of Service, known as SOS for short, is a youth-oriented summer community service outreach. Each June around 30 churches from various denominational backgrounds send youth and adult sponsors for a Thursday through Sunday event hosted at Bethel College. On Friday and Saturday hundreds of people fan out in teams across Michiana to help paint low-income homes in cooperation with local government, clean up parks, conduct block parties, do free car washes, or serve however needed. In the evenings there is fellowship, worship and teaching. For about a 7 year period, Faith Community Church had done the majority of organizing, along with volunteers from a number of other churches. Since then, others have taken up the leadership torch and FCC has been a participant.
