Our Vision: To be a Community of Believers committed to the Lordship of Jesus Christ and to the Ministry of the Holy Spirit, Welcoming People into the local congregation and Partnering with Ministries and Missionaries around the world for Spreading the Good News of the Kingdom.

Our Mission: We are an Evangelical church, meaning that we take the Bible seriously as the definitive Word of God and that we are called to actively make it's Good News known. We are an Empowered church, meaning that it is our desire and intention to cooperate with God's work in the world today as He empowers us with whatever gifts, strengths, and passion is needed to show Himself strong. We are an Engaged church, meaning that we deliberately involve ourselves in the lives of fellow believers in the local church; that we seek out opportunities to serve our local community even as we share the news of salvation in Jesus Christ; and that we actively participate and support global ministry efforts.
