    <h3>Our Vision</h3>
    <p>
    We see ourselves as only one of Michiana's great churches serving a great God in great cities. Through His people God spreads His message of salvation and love in Jesus Christ to a needy world. We are evangelical and rely on the Holy Spirit's empowering to engage in other's lives both locally and globally.
    </p>

    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
    <p>
    We are an <strong>Evangelical</strong> church, meaning that we take the Bible seriously as the definitive Word of God and that we are called to actively make it's Good News known. We are an <strong>Empowered</strong> church, meaning that it is our desire and intention to cooperate with God's work in the world today as He empowers us with whatever gifts, strengths, and passion is needed to show Himself strong. We are an <strong>Engaged</strong> church, meaning that we deliberately involve ourselves in the lives of fellow believers in the local church; that we seek out opportunities to serve our local community even as we share the news of salvation in Jesus Christ; and that we actively participate and support global ministry efforts.
    </p>
