                When you are looking for a home church people wonder whether there will be people like them there. We are a multigenerational church with newborn babies clear up to folks facing end-of-life issues. We have marrieds, singles, and families, people just like you would meet anywhere. Some work in construction, in education, in business, are students or retired.
            </p>

                We are a small or medium size church depending on your definition. We have a huge facility, but we do not fill it all up yet at this point. Although we do not belong to a particular denomination, we have people from a variety of backgrounds and we do cooperate in ministry with a several area churches. Unlike some churches, we still sing a couple of hymns weekly to connect us to the past, but most of our music is contemporary and is played with a full band.
