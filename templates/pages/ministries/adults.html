                In addition to corporate worship and other whole group times, there are ministries geared specifically toward adults. Most every Sunday at 9:30AM there are <em>small groups</em>, some of which are reminiscent of Sunday School classes, while others are more relational. Wednesdays at 6:30PM there is an adult Bible study and a women's group, which also cares for the infants.

                Beyond settings aroud the Word, there are social events in homes or at the facility; occasional sporting events; annual special events where we eat together; and much more.
